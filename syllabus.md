## IMPORTANT NOTICE - <u>Masks are required in this class</u>
* Please make sure you are wearing a face mask fully covering both mouth and nose _before_ you enter the classroom and keep it in place _at all times_.
* Make sure you have a "properly-fitting, high-quality mask (preferably a surgical mask, KN95/KF94, N95, or [EHRS-recommended Aries mask](https://ehrs.upenn.edu/covid-19/universal-mask-and-cloth-face-covering-precautions) as opposed to a single layer cloth mask)." (UPenn Public Health Guidance).

## Course Description, Goals and Objectives

In this hands-on course students will learn how to manage large textual datasets (e.g. Twitter, news stories, song lyrics, YouTube comments) to investigate research questions. They will work through a series of steps to _collect_,
_organize_, _analyze_ and _present_ textual data by using basic Python coding toward a final project of relevant interest.  The course will cover linguistic theory and techniques that can be applied to textual data (particularly from the fields of corpus linguistics and natural language processing).

**_No prior programming experience is required._** Through this course students will gain skills writing Python programs to handle large amounts of textual data and become familiar with one of the key techniques used by data scientists, which is currently one of the most in-demand jobs.

* This course will provide an introduction to Python programming for collecting, preparing and analyzing text data from various sources including
social media (e.g. Twitter), weblogs, online news media and various publicly available archives (e.g. presidential speech archive, congressional sessions).

* Each week one session will be in lecture and seminar form and provide background for the theory and techniques and the second will be a lab session
in which students will work through programming exercises using Jupyter notebooks [A web-based programming environment well suited for data science and class-based assignments].

* By completing this course students will:
	* gain an understanding of relevant linguistic concepts for the analysis of text
	* understand the field of corpus linguistics and how its concepts and tools can be applied to text analysis questions of relevance to Communication
	* be exposed to a range of techniques from natural language processing and understand how they can be used to improve content analyses
	* gain a basic level of programming proficiency in the Python programming language and have completed a number of programming exercises to build, cleanÂ and analysis corpora of text
	* complete a data science project focused the analysis of text data and gain group work and collaborative skills

----

## Textbooks and resources

* The main readings on corpus linguistics will come from:
	* Baker, P. (2006) _Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis_. London: Continuum

* and on Python programming and NLP concepts from:
	* Bird, S., Klein, E. & Loper, E. _Natural Language Processing with Python - Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit._ Updated version for Python 3. Available free online at http://www.nltk.org/book/

----

## Assessment

1. **Complete the assigned readings and corpus building exercises (10%)**
	* Readings for each week will be posted on Canvas when electronic versions are available or taken from one of the recommended textbooks.
	* Throughout the course you will be asked to complete short writing exercises that will be used to build a class corpus for analysis. Details will be discussed in class and posted on Canvas.
		* Examples of the prompts might be:
			* _Describe your interest in Communication research._
			* _Look at this picture closely for a minute and then write a paragraph describing what you see._
			* _Write about your earliest memory._
			* _Create a recipe for a fried or boiled egg for your room mate who doesn't know how to cook._
2. **Attend weekly lab sessions and complete the assigned exercises (40%)**
    * Thursday class sessions will _usually_ be programming labs. Students are required to bring a laptop. Please contact the me if this is difficult and we can see if a machine can be made available for use in lab.
	* We will be using Jupyter notebooks to learn Python, which are a web-based interactive programming environment. You will need a `github` account (https://education.github.com/) to access the class server. Assignments will be completed in this and submitted to the instructor. Details of using this system for assignments will be covered in the first lab session.
	* Weekly assignments will be due at 5pm on the Tuesday following lab session (see schedule for details). These assignments are intended to help students practice the programming concepts and structures introduced in lab and build confidence. They should not be difficult or take excessive time but they do build from week to week so it is _very_ important to keep up.
3. **Complete a _group project_ that uses the techniques and theory covered in class to 
carry out a text analysis of a specific research question agreed upon with the instructor (50%)**
     * The goal of the project is to practice the coding skills and analytic techniques learned in the class by carrying out a focused data science project. The steps involved will include:
	   1. Select a tractable research question that involves analysis of textual data
	   2. Identify, retrieve and prepare a relevant corpus
	   3, Carry out linguistic analysis of corpus and produce a series of well documented analysis notebooks
	   4. Visualize the data and findings
	   5. Interpret the findings
	   6, Finally, produce a data blog post (similar to those on medium.com) to communicate your findings
	   
     * You will work in a group of 3 or 4
	* You can build your own group with those you know in the class and you share an 
interest for a particular research topic
	* If there are pairs who want to work together we will find another one or two 
people to make up the group

     * More details of the kinds of projects that would be appropriate and manageable will be discussed during the first few weeks of class.


## Note about learning programming

A central goal of this class is to help students begin to develop programming skills that they can use to approach questions of interest using the growing amounts of textual data available in the era of 'big data'. But like learning any new skill, such as a new language, it takes time and can be frustrating at first. This course does not require students to have any programming background. Realistically it is not possible to become a fully proficient programmer in just one semester. However, the lab sessions and assignments are focused on helping you begin this process and to become comfortable with reading, understanding and modifying Python code examples that you can find on the web etc.
